## 🚀 Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment using GitHub Actions. To deploy:

```bash
# 1. Initialize git repository if not already done
git init

# 2. Create and switch to development branch
git checkout -b development

# 3. Add all files
git add .

# 4. Initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Text Detector implementation"

# 5. Create GitHub repository (if not already done)
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-text-detector.git

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin development

# 7. Create pull request from development to main
# This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Run tests across multiple Node.js versions
2. Build the project for production
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Send a notification when deployment is complete

## 🌟 Features

- **Advanced Detection Algorithm**: Combines multiple text analysis methods for high accuracy
- **Multilingual Support**: Works with English, Spanish, French, German, and more
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides comprehensive metrics about the analyzed text
- **Text Comparison**: Compare two texts to determine similarity and AI probability for each
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive design with multiple themes
- **Accessibility Features**: High contrast mode, font size adjustment, and reduced motion
- **Offline Capability**: Can analyze text without an internet connection
- **Privacy-Focused**: Analysis performed locally in the browser
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UIs

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Enter or paste text into the text input area
2. Click "Analyze Text" button
3. View results showing AI probability and confidence metrics
4. For comparison, use the "Compare Texts" section to analyze two texts side by side

## 🔧 Core Modules

- **AIDetector**: Main module for analyzing text and determining AI probability
- **TextModel**: Analyzes textual characteristics like word frequencies, readability, and syntax
- **LanguageModel**: Handles language-specific analysis and detection
- **UIController**: Manages user interface interactions and updates
- **LanguageManager**: Provides multilingual support and translations
- **StorageService**: Handles data persistence and user preferences
- **AnalyticsService**: Optional usage tracking with privacy controls
- **ErrorBoundary**: Provides resilience against runtime errors
- **LazyLoad**: Enables efficient loading of components

## 🔍 How It Works

The AI Text Detector uses a combination of techniques to identify AI-generated text:

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Examines patterns of word usage, sentence structure, and text complexity
2. **Linguistic Features**: Analyzes language-specific features and patterns
3. **Semantic Coherence**: Evaluates the logical flow and consistency of content
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compares texts against known patterns of human vs. AI writing

The tool generates a probability score indicating how likely the text was created by an AI system, along with a confidence level for the analysis.

## 🌐 Supported Languages

- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add more languages
- Improve detection accuracy for short texts
- Integrate with additional AI detection techniques
- Add API for programmatic access
- Create browser extensions
