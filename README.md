## 🧠 How It Works

The AI Text Detector uses a sophisticated algorithm to analyze various text characteristics:

1. **Sentence Length Analysis**: Examines consistency in sentence structure
2. **Repetition Scoring**: Identifies patterns in word usage
3. **Sentence Variance**: Measures natural variation in writing style
4. **Transition Phrase Detection**: Identifies common AI writing patterns
5. **Text Length Ratio**: Analyzes the relationship between word count and sentence count

The algorithm combines these factors to calculate an AI probability score, helping users identify potentially AI-generated content.
