# 🏗️ Project Architecture

## Overview

The AI Text Detector is a client-side web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It operates entirely in the browser without requiring server-side processing for the core functionality.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend Structure

```
index.html          # Main application with AI detection functionality
├── HTML Structure  # Semantic markup for the application
├── CSS Styling     # Inline styles for appearance and responsiveness
└── JavaScript      # Core functionality and UI interactions
    ├── Text Analysis Functions
    ├── Language Switching
    ├── UI Controllers
    └── Export/Share Functionality
```

### Supporting Pages

```
blog.html           # Educational content about AI detection
educators.html      # Specialized tools for teachers
```

### Key Components

1. **AI Detection Engine**
   - Analyzes text characteristics (sentence length, repetition, etc.)
   - Calculates AI probability score
   - Provides detailed text statistics

2. **Multilingual System**
   - Supports 7 languages
   - Translates UI elements and messages
   - Maintains consistent functionality across languages

3. **Responsive UI**
   - Adapts to different screen sizes
   - Reorganizes layout for mobile devices
   - Maintains usability across platforms

## Data Flow

1. User inputs text in the textarea
2. Text is processed by the analysis functions
3. Results are calculated and displayed to the user
4. Optional: Results can be exported or shared

## Client-Side Processing

All text analysis happens directly in the browser:
- No data is sent to external servers for processing
- User privacy is maintained as text never leaves the browser
- Results are generated instantly without network latency

## Planned Architecture Improvements

1. **Modular Code Structure**
   ```
   /js
   ├── ai-detector.js     # Core detection algorithm
   ├── ui-controller.js   # UI interactions
   ├── language-manager.js # Multilingual support
   └── utils.js           # Helper functions
   ```

2. **CSS Organization**
   ```
   /css
   ├── main.css           # Core styles
   ├── dark-theme.css     # Dark mode styles
   └── responsive.css     # Mobile-specific styles
   ```

3. **Enhanced Components**
   - Service worker for offline capabilities
   - Local storage for user preferences
   - Debugging module for development
   - Testing framework for quality assurance
